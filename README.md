# Password Generator
The program prompts for password length (between 8 & 128 characters) and what other parameters the user would like in their password (uppercase, lowercase, numeric & special characters) but must have at least one selected.
If a character is selected by the user, at least one of those characters MUST be included in the generated password.

This program was created to get used to javascript functions and how they are called. I learnt about global variables and touched on regular expressions (used for checking the password)
